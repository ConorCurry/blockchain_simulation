# Conclusions:

Our data analysis indicated that adjusting the block size to twice the normal size yielded statistically significant results. Thus, the null hypothesis can be rejected, and we can conclude that increasing the blocks size will significantly affect the fee cost. Adjusting the block size to half the normal size did not produce statistically significant results, so we fail to reject the null hypothsis. It is presumed that decreasing the block size will not significantly affect fees, however further data analysis is necessary to prove either way.

Based on the results collected, it can be concluded that manipulation of the block size has an impact on the transaction fees. This is significant as it could have the potential to impact the yield of Bitcoin mining in the future.

Input analysis determined that runs are loosely correlated with fees, r = 0.5. Runs were not measured in the simulation, however it appeared that the wait queue size increased consistantly between blocks throughout the simulation.
