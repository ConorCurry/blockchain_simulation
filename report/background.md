# Background

Bitcoin is the most widely used cryptocurrency protocol, that has enabled the growth of a major global economic system over the past few years. The one of the core innovations that makes it possible is the consensus-oriented, distributed database known as the blockchain. The blockchain represents the collective history of Bitcoin – a complete ledger of all coin ownership and transactions.

A Bitcoin transaction is performed by submitting the desired transaction to the network. As it traverses the network nodes, it may be picked up by a 'Bitcoin miner'. The job of these miners is to add new blocks to the blockchain, by solving difficult mathematical problems – computing hash preimages. This is called the blockchain's _Proof of Work_. As they perform work to find a valid solution to the preimage problem, they are free to add any new transactions they notice on the network. Upon finding a solution, the block is added to the blockchain, and the transactions that were included in the block are now part of Bitcoin's collective history.

It is important to note that the miners are not forced to add transactions to a block. Instead, when submitting a transaction, a Bitcoin user should provide a fee that can be collected by the miner when solving the block. This provides incentive for the miner to include transactions in their block solutions. The other important facet of the blockchain examined in this simulation is the blocksize limit: currently 1MB. This means that for any particular block, transactions are put into a kind of fuzzy priority queue on the network, as they wait to be selected for inclusion in a block – where space is limited. This waiting time is enforced by the difficulty of computing preimages, and set to be approximately 10 minutes.
