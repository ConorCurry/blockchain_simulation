# Introduction

As the Bitcoin protocol becomes more and more accepted, new problems have arisen that lead some to doubt the long term feasibility of the currency and underlying blockchain technology. There is much discussion surrounding the so called “blocksize debate”. The 1MB limit has caused delays in low-fee transactions, leading to larger fee amounts in order to be put on the blockchain in a reasonable amount of time. There have been occurrences of runs of full blocks lasting for several hours, and in some cases there may have been malicious actors attempting to slow the network, or increase required transaction fees. While some may argue this is inconvienent for users of the currency, inhibiting widespread adoption, this is the expected plan for the Bitcoin ecosystem. When coinbase transactions stop generating Bitcoins, fees will be relied upon to support the miners in their verification of blocks. It is unknown how scarce a resource space on the blockchain will be, or how competetive the 'fee market' will become. However, these are the sorts of questions we hope to start developing answers for with this simulation.

The overarching goal of our simulation is to conduct an analysis of the stability of the queueing system found in Bitcoin. Given parameters determined via input validated data from the blockchain itself, we seek to determine the likelihood of runs of full blocks, likely cost estimates per byte on the blockchain, and the possible effects of increasing the blocksize. We hope to observe the dynamics of user-miner interactions in the bitcoin system, as a function of inclusion in the blockchain. It is important to note that there are several consequences of increasing the blocksize (such as increased centralization, or block-withholding attacks) that the simulation will not be able to accurately model due to simplifiying assumptions. Yet we hope that the data collected from the runs of this simulation will promote more informed decision making regarding Bitcoin's scalability and possibilities for the future of the protocol.
