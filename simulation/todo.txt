TODO:

Establish all of the distributions to use
    - Gamma Distribution generates the lambda for the exponential distribution for transaction arrivals
    - Exponential distribution generates the block arrivals
    - Exponential distribution with lambda from gamma generates the transaction arrivals

Establish all of the parameters to those distributions

Then, organize the functions that take those distributions.

When a block arrives:
    Set a new transaction lambda
    Generate the next block arrival time

When a transaction arrives:
    Generate the next transaction arrival time

How do I handle prices?
