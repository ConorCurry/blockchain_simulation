                        <p>New problems have arisen leading some to doubt long term feasability of Bitcoin currency and underlying blockchain technology as the protocol becomes more accepted</p>
                        <p>Lots of discussion surrounding 'blocksize debate' - 1 MB limit causes delays in low-fee transactions, leading to larger fee amounts in order to be put on the blockchain in a reasonable of time</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>Runs of full blocks can last for several hours, increasing the likelihood of security breaches</p>
                        <p>When coinbase transactions stop generating Bitcoin, fees will be relied upon to support miners in verification of blocks - it is unknown how scarce a resource space on the blockchain will be, or how competitive the 'fee market' will become</p>

                        <p><b>Goal:</b> To conduct an analysis of the stability of the queueing system found in Bitcoin</p>
                        <p>Given parameters determined via input validated data from the blockchain itself, we seek to determine the likelihood of runs of full blocks, likely cost estimates per byte on the blockchain, and the possible effects of increasing the block size</p>
                        <p>We hope to observe the dynamics of user-miner interactions in the Bitcoin system, as a function of inclusion in the blockchain</p>
