                        <p>New problems have arisen leading some to doubt long term feasability of Bitcoin currency and underlying blockchain technology as the protocol becomes more accepted</p>
                        <p>Lots of discussion surrounding 'blocksize debate' - 1 MB limit causes delays in low-fee transactions, leading to larger fee amounts in order to be put on the blockchain in a reasonable of time</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Runs of full blocks can last for several hours, increasing the likelihood of security breaches</p>
                        <p>When coinbase transactions stop generating Bitcoin, fees will be relied upon to support miners in verification of blocks - it is unknown how scarce a resource space on the blockchain will be, or how competitive the 'fee market' will become</p>
